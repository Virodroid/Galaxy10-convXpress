# Galaxy10-convXpress
Implementation of convXpress CNN for Galaxy10 Dataset.
## Train the model:
To train the model first ensure that all of the requirements are installed.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Next download the Galaxy10 DECaLS dataset and place it in the project root directory.

Galaxy10 DECaLS can be downloaded [here](https://astro.utoronto.ca/~hleung/shared/Galaxy10/Galaxy10_DECals.h5)

Finally run the ```train_model.py``` file:
```
python train_model.py
```

## Evaluate the model:
Model evaluation is done in the Jupyter Notebook Files found in the ```notebooks``` driectory. SImply navigate there and open them in Jupyter Notebooks or Lab.
